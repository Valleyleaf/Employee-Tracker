// Psudo-Code.

// Options needed: Departments, Roles, Employees.
// Function to create a new employee with all of the above added. This can be done with inquierer.
// Each of these options will be a multi-selection. Department will give the option of choosing all departments and roles.


// On application start. You will get the option of viewing departments, roles and employees.
// Departments will show department name and ids.

// on viewing roles, you will see the job title, id, department and salery.

// On viewing employees, you will see first and last name, job title, department, salery and their manager.

// Managers will be attached to departments. Note that you should be able to add new departments.

// For extra credit, do I want to make a function that allows you to select the manager of each department. Upon change,
// Should there be a function to warn that you are moving the admin title to someone else? Would be cool.
